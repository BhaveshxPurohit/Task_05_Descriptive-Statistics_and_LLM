# Research Task – The Legacy of Team India: LLM Interaction Project

📌 **Overview**  
This project explores the use of **large language models (LLMs)** to generate insights about Team India’s cricket performance. It builds upon prior experience in generating textual summaries and analyzing datasets.  

In this project, I:  

- Used a detailed narrative of Team India’s recent matches, player stats, and historical performance.  
- Drafted 10 natural language prompts for multiple LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4).  
- Compared LLM responses with manually calculated statistics or factual records from match data.  
- Wrote Python scripts to answer questions that could not be directly inferred from the narrative or LLM responses.

🏟 **Project Objective**  
- Analyze Team India’s performance using AI-generated insights.  
- Create structured prompts to extract player-level, match-level, and historical insights.  
- Compare and evaluate LLM responses for accuracy and completeness.  
- Write Python scripts for questions requiring computation beyond what the narrative or LLM could provide.  

Example areas of focus:  

- Top run-scorers in the last series  
- Player performance trends across venues  
- Historical comparisons against rival teams  
- Predictions for upcoming matches

⚙️ **How It Works**

### Narrative Preparation
- A detailed narrative covering Team India’s batting, bowling, and fielding stats was prepared.  
- Sections were created for **player-specific analysis**, **match summaries**, and **historical comparisons**.

### Prompt Design
- 10 prompts were drafted for the LLMs. Example prompts include:  
  1. “List the top 3 run-scorers in the last 5 matches of Team India.”  
  2. “Compare the bowling economy rates of the top 5 bowlers.”  
  3. “Identify the player with the highest strike rate in home vs away matches.”  
  4. “Summarize Team India’s performance against England in the last 3 series.”  
  5. “Which players improved the most over the last season?”  
  6. “Highlight key partnerships contributing to wins in the last 10 matches.”  
  7. “Compare captaincy impact on match outcomes for different captains.”  
  8. “Provide a summary of player fielding statistics.”  
  9. “Identify patterns in scoring by venue.”  
  10. “Predict potential top performers for the upcoming series.”  

### LLM Interaction
- Prompts submitted to multiple LLMs (ChatGPT, GPT-4).  
- Responses captured and documented.  
- Outputs evaluated for factual accuracy, completeness, and readability.

### Python Analysis
- For questions not directly answerable by LLMs, Python scripts were used to compute results from structured match data.  
- Examples: calculating average strike rates, aggregating player statistics, and identifying trends across matches.

📊 **Key Learning Outcomes**
This project helped me:

- Understand **strengths and limitations of LLMs** for sports analysis.  
- Refine **prompt design** to obtain clearer, more accurate responses.  
- Compare AI-generated insights with human-calculated results.  
- Automate portions of analysis while validating against factual data.  
- Develop a workflow for structured **LLM interaction and evaluation**.

🔗 **Continuation from Previous Work**
This project builds on previous textual and statistical analysis, expanding the scope to **LLM-assisted cricket insights**, enabling faster, AI-driven interpretation of player and team performance.
